# IB-CS-Project
Backup for IB CS Project

This repository stores all files that were used to create the IB Computer Science Final programming project. This project was designed to create a basic inventory system that could be accessed online. 

The main language of this project was Java and the database uses SQL through MySQL.
The database was hosted online but is no longer active.

The main concept that were used were OOP. While not part of the syllabus I added a basic Caesar Cipher to encrypt the passwords of all the users. The encrypted passwords were the ones that were stored and which is what was compared with the password that was entered after it goes through the encryption process. 
The Caesar Cipher was something that I created because I wanted to add a bit of security. 

There are multiple changes that would be done if this project would have been taken further.
